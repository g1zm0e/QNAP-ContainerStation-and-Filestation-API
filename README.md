# QNAP-ContainerStation-and-Filestation-API
QNAP ContainerStation and FileStation API Python Classes for Login and basic orchestration.


This is my first pass oriented programming, Some of this code is borrowed from https://github.com/mdhorda/qnap that had the QNAP login for Storage Station and retrofitted in ContainerStation. This code can successfully deploy a container, I will add more to the example as I can. 

Only Requirements is urllib3 and request, base python install should have the rest.
